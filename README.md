# Assignment 1: Protests
In recent years the United States has experienced a surge of protests, in support of Black Lives Matter, gender equity, and other social or political issues.

In this assignment, you will work with data from [Count Love](https://countlove.org/), data that is ocassionally [cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/black-lives-matter-protest.html) by the _New York Times_ when reporting on US demonstrations.

## Learning objectives
By completing the assignment, you will demonstrate the following skills:

- Use of **version control** for managing your code
- Declaring document rendering using **markdown** syntax
- Foundation programming skills in R
- Critical think about data.

## The Assignment
**Instructions and grading**. Assignment instructions, and grading information, 
are available in this file: [analysis.R](analysis.R).

**Eight assignment parts**. The file [analysis.R](analysis.R) consists of eight parts.

* Parts 1-6 require you to code in R.
* Part 7 prompts you to critically think about the Count Love dataset.
* Part 8 prompts you to consider your learning.

**Coding and reflection prompts**. You will find two kinds of prompts in [analysis.R](analysis.R):

* *Coding prompts*, which prompt you to write R code in [analysis.R](analysis.R).
* *Reflection prompts*, which prompt you to write responses below
in this file (`README.md`).

**Formatting Your Responses and Reflections**.

* When formatting your written
responses and reflections below, please *retain* all
reflection prompt IDs (e.g., (R.1a), (R.2a), etc.).
* To write clearly,
use markdown code - for example, use **bold**, _italics_, and `code` appropriately; include images or links (if useful); and so forth.

**Getting started**. To get started, we suggest that you open [analysis.R](analysis.R) in RStudio
and open this file in Atom. Or, you might find it more convenient to open
both files in RStudio and flip back and forth with the tabs.

Key point: In [analysis.R](analysis.R), write R code; in this file below,
write in English.

**Questions?** As always, please post on Teams or ask your Instructor or Teaching Assistant.

:computer: Good coding!
   :writing_hand: Good critical thinking!
      :smile: Good-luck!
