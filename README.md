# Assignment 1: Protests
In recent years the United States has experienced a surge of protests, in support of Black Lives Matter, gender equity, and other social or political issues.

In this assignment, you will work with data from [Count Love](https://countlove.org/), data that is ocassionally [cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/black-lives-matter-protest.html) by the _New York Times_ when reporting on US demonstrations.

## Learning objectives
By completing the assignment, you will develop or skills for:

- **Version control** (git and GitHub) for managing your code
- Writing documents with **markdown** syntax
- Coding in R
- Thinking critcally about data.

## The Assignment
**Instructions and grading**. Assignment instructions, and grading information, 
are available in this file: [analysis.R](analysis.R).

**Eight assignment parts**. The file [analysis.R](analysis.R) consists of eight parts.

* Parts 1-6 require you to code in R.
* Part 7 prompts you to critically think about the Count Love dataset.
* Part 8 prompts you to consider your learning.

**Coding and reflection prompts**. You will find two kinds of prompts in [analysis.R](analysis.R):

* *Coding prompts*, which prompt you to write R code in [analysis.R](analysis.R).
* *Reflection prompts*, which prompt you think. You will write your responses below, 
in this file (`README.md`).

**Formatting Your Responses and Reflections**.

* When formatting your written
responses and reflections below, please *retain* all
reflection prompt IDs (e.g., R1a, R2a, etc.).
* Fill in the elipses (...) with your own words. 
* Remove expected word counts.
* To write clearly, use markdown code appropriately (e.g., **bold**, _italics_, and `code`). As appropriate, include images, links, and so forth.

**Getting started**. To get started, we suggest that you open [analysis.R](analysis.R) 
and this file in RStudio.

Key point: In [analysis.R](analysis.R), write R code; in this file below,
write in English.

**Questions?** As always, please post on Teams or ask your Instructor or Teaching Assistant.

:computer: Good coding!
   :writing_hand: Good critical thinking!
      :smile: Good-luck!
