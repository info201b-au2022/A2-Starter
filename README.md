# Assignment 1: Protests
In recent years the United States has experienced a surge of protests, in support of Black Lives Matter, gender equity, and many other social or political issues.

In this assignment, you will work with data from [Count Love](https://countlove.org/), data that is ocassionally [cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/black-lives-matter-protest.html) by the _New York Times_ when reporting on US demonstrations.

Through this assignment, you will be able to answer questions about protests, including:

* What were the most attended and least attended protests in the US in the last 5 years?
* How many protests occurred in Washington state?
* How did the number of protests in 2019 compare to 2020, and why?
* Why are people protesting in the US? What are the biggest motivators?

## Learning objectives
By completing the assignment, you will develop or skills for:

- **Version control** tools for managing code (git and GitHub)
- Writing documents with **markdown** syntax
- Coding in R
- Thinking critcally about data.

## Critical Analysis & Reflection: Before You Code

Before diving into this (or any) dataset, it's important to know where the data came from, and it's important to have or to seek out _domain familiarity_ â€” that is, knowledge about the subject/topic of the dataset. (We don't want to be "strangers in the dataset," as Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein describe it.) To get more familiar, we are going to begin by doing some background reading.

- First, please read [this FAQ](https://countlove.org/faq.html) from the CountLove website and the opening of [this blog post](https://www.tommyleung.com/countLove/index.htm). Based on the information in these pieces, why did the creators start collecting the CountLove data? Please answer in 2-3 sentences (3 points)

- Next, we would like you to read this [New York Times piece that uses CountLove data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/13/us/george-floyd-protests-cities-photos.html) and that describes the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred in the summer of 2020. Please summarize the main point or argument of this article in 2-3 sentences (3 points)

Next, we're going to reflect about who collected this data, and what's actually inside it. **Note:** Please your answers below under the heading "Your Responses and Reflections."

**(R1a)** Who collected and shared the CountLove data, and what do they do for a living?

**(R1b)** As Klein and D'Ignazio remind us, when it comes to data, "what gets counted counts." What types of demonstrations does CountLove include in their data, and what types do they exclude? 

**(R1c)** How and where does CountLove get their data about the protests? 

**(R1d)** How does CountLove make their estimates about the number of people who attended a protest? What potential problems might arise from this method of estimation? 

## The Assignment
**Instructions**. Assignment instructions, and grading information, 
are available in this file: [analysis.R](analysis.R).

**Eight assignment parts**. The file [analysis.R](analysis.R) consists of eight parts.

* Parts 1-6 require you to code in R.
* Part 7 prompts you to critically think about the Count Love dataset.
* Part 8 prompts you to consider your learning.

**Coding and reflection prompts**. You will find two kinds of prompts in [analysis.R](analysis.R):

* *Coding prompts*, which prompt you to write R code in [analysis.R](analysis.R).
* *Reflection prompts*, which prompt you think. You will write your responses below, 
in this file (`README.md`).

**Formatting Your Responses and Reflections**.

* When formatting your written
responses and reflections below, please *retain* all
reflection prompt IDs (e.g., R1a, R2a, etc.).
* Fill in the elipses (...) with your own words. 
* Remove expected word counts.
* To write clearly, use markdown code appropriately (e.g., **bold**, _italics_, and `code`). As appropriate, include images, links, and so forth.

**Getting started**. To get started, we suggest that you open [analysis.R](analysis.R) 
and this file in RStudio.

Key point: In [analysis.R](analysis.R), write R code; in this file below,
write in English.

**Questions?** As always, please post on Teams or ask your Instructor or Teaching Assistant.

:computer: Good coding!
   :writing_hand: Good critical thinking!
      :smile: Good-luck!
